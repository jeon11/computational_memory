# computational_memory

This repo contains core pieces of codes from ongoing projects, including behavioral and EEG experiments using PsychoPy (Python) and NetStation (EEG Acquisition Software).

Below are brief summaries of each code:

#### catFmri_eeg_sound.py:
  - EEG experiment code for exploring category clustering in memory
  - Full operation requires corresponding stimuli files and images

#### decode_all_wav.py:
  - Customized Python script that converts wav speech files to text using Quail and Google Speech API

#### sfv_eeg1.py:
  - PsychoPy builder-based experiment code customized with EEG code to study of semantic feature verification

#### response_check.py:
  - Ongoing work on processing basic data analysis on subjects' performance
